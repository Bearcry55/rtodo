# rtodo: Your Simple Terminal Todo List

`rtodo` is a straightforward and efficient command-line application designed to help you manage your tasks directly from the terminal. It's built with Rust and offers features like adding, editing, deleting, marking tasks as complete, and sorting.

## Installation

To install and run `rtodo`, you'll first need to have **Rust and Cargo** installed on your system. Cargo is Rust's package manager and build system, and it makes installing `rtodo` incredibly easy.

### Step 1: Install Rust and Cargo

If you don't have Rust and Cargo installed yet, the easiest way is to use `rustup`, the official Rust toolchain installer.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf [https://sh.rustup.rs](https://sh.rustup.rs) | sh
cargo --version
cargo install --git [https://github.com/Bearcry55/rtodo.git](https://github.com/Bearcry55/rtodo.git)
rtodo
now you can run the program
